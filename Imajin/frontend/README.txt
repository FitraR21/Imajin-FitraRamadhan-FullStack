# Imajin Frontend

Next.js frontend for the marketplace prototype.

Design inspired by [Figma Marketplace Template](https://www.figma.com/community/website-templates/marketplace) (not copied directly).

A reusable layout component provides a consistent header, navigation, and footer across all pages.

Quick start (Windows cmd.exe):

```cmd
cd c:\workspace\Imajin\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the backend to run at `http://localhost:4000` by default.
